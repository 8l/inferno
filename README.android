===Phone interface===
Turn on the radio (you'll want to do this before anything else):
 echo on > /phone/ctl
Turn off the radio:
 echo off > /phone/ctl
Turn on the data connection:
 echo net on > /phone/ctl
Turn off the data connection:
 echo net off > /phone/ctl
Route the audio to a different device:
 echo route <earpiece/speaker/headphone> > /phone/ctl
Change the call volume:
 echo volume <0-5> > /phone/ctl
Mute/unmute your microphone:
 echo <mute/unmute> > /phone/ctl

Dial a number:
 echo dial <number> > /phone/phone
Hang up a call:
 echo hangup > /phone/phone
Pick up an incoming call:
 echo answer > /phone/phone

Send an SMS:
 echo send <number> <quoted message> > /phone/sms

Reading from /phone/ctl returns "off" or "on" depending on whether the
driver thinks the radio is off or on. There's no way to query the
power state from RIL, though, so if you have the radio powered on
before Inferno starts it will still return "off."

/phone/signal gives you the raw signal strength value, 0-30 or 99 for
failure. It may be different for CDMA phones.

Reading from /phone/phone will give you messages when the phone rings
and when the call state has changed. You should read from /phone/calls
when the call state changes.

Reading from /phone/calls gives you a list of calls. The device dumps
all the information it gets, but the information that you probably
care about the most is the state of each call and the number of the
other party. The state is a value 0-5:
| Value | Meaning  |
|-------+----------|
|     0 | Active   |
|     1 | Holding  |
|     2 | Dialing  |
|     3 | Alerting |
|     4 | Incoming |
|     5 | Waiting  |
